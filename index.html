    <h1>Semantics HTML Tag</h1>
    <p>One significant difference between HTML5 and previous versions is HTML5's emphasis on semantics. Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to provide meaning of the information in an HTML document rather than merely define its presentation.
    <p>
      HTML5 does not include elements purely for presentation. This is because presentation is the domain of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Therefore, we use HTML to provide structure and meaning, and CSS to define how those elements are presented. In other words, if you want to specify a font family, use CSS. If you want to specify large text, use CSS. And if you want to define an element's alignment, use CSS.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Of course, having said this, browsers will always present elements in a particular in the absence of any style sheets. For example, when you specify a list, the default presentation will be either bullet points (for an unordered list) or numbers (for an ordered list). But the most important thing is that you have provided meaning by specifying either an unordered list or an ordered list. That way, browsers (and other software) can make use of your HTML markup by presenting your list in a particular wayâ€”and this can often be dictated by the context in which the information is being presented.
